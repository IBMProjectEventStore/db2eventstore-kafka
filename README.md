# IBM Db2 Event Store Streaming Connector for Kafka

*Questions about this material*? Reach me on Twitter [@Loic Julien](https://twitter.com/loicjulien)

The IBM Db2 Event Store is an in-memory database optimized for event-driven data processing and analysis. [Download the free developer edition or the enterprise edition](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/db2-event-store)

In order to run our Open Source Apache Kafka Connector, follow the steps below:

## Pre-requisites
```
Install sbt at the version 0.13.16
git clone git@github.com:IBMProjectEventStore/db2eventstore-kafka.git
cd db2eventstore-kafka
```

check your sbt version with:
```
sbt sbtVersion
```
Output:
...
[info] kafkaQueue/*:sbtVersion
[info] 	0.13.16
[info] dataLoad/*:sbtVersion
[info] 	0.13.16
[info] eventStream/*:sbtVersion
[info] 	0.13.16
[info] db2eventstoreKafka/*:sbtVersion
[info] 	0.13.16

## Compile
```
sbt clean
sbt compile
```

## Package
```
sbt package assembly
```

## Start Sequence when using the built-in internal kafka broker
1. Run the Db2 Event Store Streaming Connector
2. Run the Data Generator
This order isn't necessary if using an external kafka broker

## Run the Db2 Event Store Streaming Connector

This connector could be run standalone, without the generator described in the section *Run the Data Generator*. However, the JSON sent to the queue currently needs to comply with the format described in the section Underlying Json format.

### Run command
Once you have run sbt package assembly, you can run the following command, after updating the eventStore option to point to a running Db2 Event Store service.

```
sbt "eventStream/run -localBroker true -kafkaBroker localhost:9092 -topic estopic -eventStore 9.30...:18730;9.30....:1101,9.30....:1101,9.30....:1101 -database TESTDB -user admin  -password password -metadata sensor -streamingInterval 5000 -batchSize 1000 -trustStoreLocation <trustStore file location> -trustStorePassword <trstStore password> -keyStoreLocation <keyStore file location> -keyStorePassword <keyStore password> -clientPluginName <plugin name>"
```

*Options*
- localBroker [Boolean]- true to use of an internal, single node, Kafka broker. False to use an externally configured Broker
- kafkaBroker [String]- Location of the Kafka broker, pass in "localhost:9092" for a local setup or the ip:port location for an external setup
- topic [String]- The Kafka topic to be used for the stream
- eventStore [String]- The IP configuration for the IBM Db2 Event Store
- database [String]- The Db2 Event Store Database to create or use
- user [String]- The Db2 Event Store user name to use
- password [String]- The Db2 Event Store password to use
- metadata [String]- The type of metadata for this IoT device, for instance "sensor" or "appliance" or "weatherstation"  
- streamingInterval [Long]- The Long value defining the length of the Apache Spark streaming window, in milliseconds
- batchSize [Int] - The size of the batch to send to the IBM Db2 Event Store
- trustStoreLocation [String] - The trust store file location for Event Store SSL connections
- trustStorePassword [String] - The trust store password for Event Store SSL connections
- keyStoreLocation [String] - The key store file location for Event Store SSL connections
- keyStorePassword [String] - The key store password for Event Store SSL connections
- clientPluginName [String] - The client plugin name for Event Store SSL connections


## Run the Data Generator

The data generator is there to help generate some data. The generated data includes a type, a timestamp, a payload value.

### Internal Kafka Broker
This example comes pre-packaged with an internal broker. However, you can also connect it to an external Kafka cluster. Set the argument localBroker accordingly
- true for having the streaming connector create an internal Broker
- false for connecting the streaming connector to an external Broker

### Run command
```
sbt "dataLoad/run -localBroker true -kafkaBroker localhost:9092 -tableName sensor -topic estopic -group group -metadata sensor -metadataId 238 -batchSize 1000"
```

*Options*
- localBroker [Boolean]- true to use of an internal, single node, Kafka broker. False to use an externally configured Broker
- kafkaBroker [String]- Location of the Kafka broker, pass in "localhost:9092" for a local setup or the ip:port location for an external setup
- tableName [String] - The table name that will be created within the IBM Db2 Event Store where you can use the form [<schemaName>.]<table name> when if schemName is not provided the default schemaName will be the userid
- topic [String]- The Kafka topic to be used for the stream
- group [String]- The Kafka group to be used for the stream
- metadata [String]- The type of metadata for this simulated IoT device, for instance "sensor" or "appliance" or "car", ...
- metadataId [Long]- The Long value that can identify this IoT device, for instance "238" or "002" or ...
- batchSize [Int]- The size of the batch that will be sent to the Kafka queue. It can be as small as 1.

### Underlying Json format
The current format generated for this sample generator is a JSON string, like this:
```
s"""{"table":"${tableName}", "payload":{"id": ${numRec}, "${metadata}": ${metadataId}, "ts":${System.currentTimeMillis()}, "value":${value}}}"""
```
- numRec is a sequence that will restart at -0- each time the generator is restarted

## IBM Db2 Event Store Table definition

The table created in the event store follows the format below. It is designed to support a payload from an IoT device of type "metadata" that sends a value at a frequent interval.

```
val tableDefinition = TableSchema(tableName, StructType(Array(
  StructField("id", LongType, nullable = false),
  StructField(s"${metadata}", LongType, nullable = false),
  StructField("ts", LongType, nullable = false),
  StructField("value", LongType, nullable = false)
)),
  shardingColumns = Seq("ts", s"${metadata}"),
  pkColumns = Seq("ts", s"${metadata}"))
val indexDefinition = IndexSpecification("IndexDefinition", tableDefinition, equalColumns = Seq(s"${metadata}"), sortColumns = Seq(SortSpecification("ts", ColumnOrder.AscendingNullsLast)), includeColumns = Seq("value"))
```

## IBM Db2 Event Store supported queries

Any type of queries could be run against the IBM Db2 Event Store. However, the definition above is such that it will allow for running subsecond range predicate queries (such as the one below), as an index is defined on the ts and the metadata columns
```
SELECT value, ts from ${tableName} where ${metadata}=${metadataId} and ts>=${timestampStartValueinMS} and ts<=${timestampEndValueinMS}
```
